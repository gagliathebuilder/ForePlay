git commit -m "feat: Establish solid MVP foundation with modular architecture

‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- Modular Swift file structure (no more monolithic ForePlayApp.swift)
- Custom golf-themed UI components (GolfMicButton, TeeRecordButton, OverlayEditor)
- VoiceEngine abstraction for OpenAI TTS + local fallback
- AnalysisKit with placeholder swing analysis (ready for Vision integration)
- ComparisonView and ShareExportManager stubs
- Clean compilation with no errors
- Comprehensive .gitignore and README

üö´ CURRENT LIMITATIONS (MVP scope):
- Vision framework pose analysis: placeholder only (tempo: 3.2, plane: 15¬∞, sway: 5cm)
- UI components not yet integrated into main views
- CaDi voice agent not wired to analysis results
- Comparison/export features are stubs

üéØ NEXT PHASE PRIORITIES:
1. Integrate golf-themed components into CaptureView
2. Wire VoiceEngine to CaDi for actual TTS
3. Implement basic video analysis (frames without pose)
4. Add comparison mode with side-by-side video players

This commit represents a clean, working foundation that can be built upon incrementally without the compilation loops we experienced with complex Vision framework integration."
